The Cafe Menu project is a project that the course on Free Code Camp that goes through the basics of CSS, which is the language for styling HTML documents.

Things I have learned:
1. Type Selectors, ID selectors, Class Selectors.
2. Block level element take the entire width of their parent element. Styling can be done to make them behave more like inline elements.
3. Inline block elements only take up the width of their content.
